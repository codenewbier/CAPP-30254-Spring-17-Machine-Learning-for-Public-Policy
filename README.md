# CAPP-30254-Spring-17-Machine-Learning-for-Public-Policy

## Course Description:

This course will be an introduction to machine learning techniques and tools as well how they can be used in public policy problems. This course is designed for public policy and social science students who are interested in learning how to use modern, scalable, computational data analysis methods and tools, and apply them to social and policy problems.

## This course teches us:

What role Machine Learning can play in designing, implementing, evaluating, and improving Public Policy
Machine Learning methods and tools, with a focus on an introduction to supervised and unsupervised methods, practical aspects of how to use them, and building machine learning pipelines using python
How to solve policy problems using Machine Learning methods and tools
This is a hands-on course where students will be expected to use Python to implement solutions to various policy problems. We will cover supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms and will learn how to use them for public policy problems in areas such as education, public health, sustainability, economic development, and public safety.
