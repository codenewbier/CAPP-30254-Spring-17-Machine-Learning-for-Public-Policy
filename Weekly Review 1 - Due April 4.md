# What I Learned From the Lectures
The first week gave us a general view of machine learning, what is does, and what should we expect from this course. I’ve heard of what fancy job can machine learning do before such as the ML applications you explained during the lecture (the Amazon recommender, autonomous cars and market adversing for example). However, what I have not known is how machine learning could actually be segmented in to 4 types of task: 
- Description: describe, analyze and understand  the dataset in the past. This is exactly what we is doing for Diagnostic Assignment. 
- Detection: correctly detect the anomalies, events, or patterns from the past data
- Prediction:  predict the happening of future event. This is what people usually think the only thing machine learning scientists are working on (and I used to think in this ways as well). Now I understand that it is only a part of machine learning. That is an interesting thing to know!
- Behavior Change: deal with casual inference in social science. What’s more important is to prevent the bad future event from happening. I had my undergraduate degree Economics and I am thrilled to know what I learned before is also part of machine learning. I would be love to combine my knowledge in Economics/Econometrics with what I will lean in this course! 

# Comments/Feedback 
Everything is good, except I am a little bit lost in the intuitional understanding in the guest
lecture talking about the US election and campaign. I feel like I could not contribute or participate in the class because as an international student I know little about the US election currently. Still, I will try to read more about these and catch up
